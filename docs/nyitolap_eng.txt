The history of the Internet dates back to the 1960s. In 1969, the US Department of War created an experimental packet-switched network (ARPAnet: Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) on telephone lines. More and more people joined the network (e.g. educational and research institutions). 
In addition to ARPAnet, the MILnet (Military Network) network operating with similar technology was created, and the two networks were connected in 1983. Several networks were then connected to ARPANET; e.g. MInet (the European equivalent of MILnet), SATnet and WIDEBAND (satellite networks), NFSnet (National Science Foundation Network), BITnet (Because It's Time Network), USEnet, etc. This is how what we know today as the Internet was born. 
In the 1990s, large computer commercial service centers (CompuServe, America Online, etc.) became accessible via the Internet and the range of business applications has been expanding rapidly ever since. ten thousand different computer networks are accessible on the Internet, serving tens of millions of users. The Internet also affects the organization of information within institutions: the intranet, a corporate information system using Internet technology, has emerged. 
Currently, Europe and America are connected by glass cables across the ocean, and data can also be transmitted via satellite. Possible perspectives of the future include the intertwining of the IT, news, telecommunications and entertainment industries and the use of the Internet network as a unified communication medium (so-called ICE age: Information - Communication - Entertainment). 
Multimedia applications that require high data transfer rates (so-called bandwidth) require the development of new technological solutions that ensure the continuous transmission of multimedia information (e.g. sounds, moving images), i.e. e.g. they guarantee the minimum bandwidth required for transmission.
